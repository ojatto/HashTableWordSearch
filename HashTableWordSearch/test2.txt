Computer science has been a rollercoaster ride for me that has been full of many ups and downs. I started in my second freshman semester. At first Java made little to no sense to me. But as time went on the projects got harder, I was forced to gain an intuitive understanding of Java. While it was always a hassle, I eventually found myself intuitively doing things I used to find hard like using constructors or Linux commands and gradually concepts that gave me nightmares like hexadecimal started to finally make sense. Last semester was a rocky one for me so I hope to make the rest of my computer science career as good one!
